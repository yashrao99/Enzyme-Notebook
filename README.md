# Enzyme-Notebook
Udacity iOS Capstone Project

Welcome to Enzymatiq - an iOS app that is built for managing and documenting biochemical experiments! A notebook in your pocket!

The main features of this app allows the user to create an experiment, and then sub-class each step in the experiment with details on the various protocols and observations for each step in an experiment. The app also allows the user to take as many pictures of their work and uploads them directly to Firebase for storage. Users can also request push notifications with customizable reminders when something in their experiment needs to be taken care of. Each step can be edited after creation, allowing users to continuously update their work. Users can also search for various protocols in the app using a custom Google Search Engine which is tailored towards (free) scientific websites.

As a plus, the theme of this app is Rick and Morty, since Rick is a genius scientist. (If you've never seen the show, hopefully you will be slightly more inclined after using this app!)

This app is hosted on Firebase - you will need a valid email or google account in order to log-in.
